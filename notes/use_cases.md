# Use Cases

## CREATING PLAYBOOKS

- CODING: Using Text Editors and Elixir Tooling as we do now

- COMPOSER UI: Could we create an authoring UI (or scripting language) that would allow someone to Assemble/Compose/Configure/Modify/Publish custom playbooks without coding?

## USING PLAYBOOKS 

- STATIC OUTPUT: Right now Iâ€™m generating Markdown. PDF and HTML output ought to be straightforward.  We also need ExDoc integration.

- DIRECTOR UI: Could we create a Web-UI for guided refactoring that reruns the playbook tests every time the code-base was updated?

## UPDATING PLAYBOOKS

- What is the best way to report playbook issues, to fork/clone/pr/version, etc. How would we support updates in the Composer/Director UI?
